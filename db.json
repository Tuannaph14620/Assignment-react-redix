I have had two tap-ins this week and every goal counts,” he reflected on his personal form.I am happy to get back to scoring ways as it has been a while.I feel like the team is so special and we have so many great players and players that can come on and make an impact.I feel like all year round everyone has played their part and chipped in with goals and assists.We need to keep that going and there will be some bad moments I am sure, but it is about how we react after that and how we bounce back.",
